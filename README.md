### DEPLOYED TO FIREBASE


### WHAT I LEARNED
This was a fun weekend project, aimed at practicing Angular. I focused on small components, clean code and adhering to Single Responsibility Principle. Splitting the app in modules allowed me to improve my architecture and design approach. I also focused on best practices for ensuring responsive design and clean CSS.

### WHY ANGULAR?
After working with vanilla JS for a number of years, and deciding I want to focus on Frontend, I started working in React - a tool I absolutelly love since the introduction of hooks. However, I was curious to discover how things are done in other frameworks. In this regard I was attracted especailly to Angular, as a sort of opposite to React (opinionated vs unopinionated). After a lot of consideration, I decided to accept a job as an Angular developer working on enterprise level projects, and explore the 'Angular way of thinking' and RxJS. There is no doubt, my React experience is making me a better Angular dev, as much as Angular is making me better in React. It's fascinating to explore how identical challenges are approached differently, but still with significant similarities. And, as my first boss used to say, 'Chose the tech based on the project'. I definitelly see Angular's significant addvantages in certain areas, React's in other, while, for my personal website, I still use HTML, CSS and vanilla JS. Long story short, I love frontend, and trully enjoy working with Angular, React and Svelte.
